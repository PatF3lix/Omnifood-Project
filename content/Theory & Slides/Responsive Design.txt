            What is responsive Design 
    
    Responsive Design:

        -Design technique to make a webpage adjust its layout and visual style yo any possible 
            screen size (window or viewport size)

        - In practice, this means that responsive design makes websites usable on all devices,
            such as desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones 

        - It's a set of practices, not separate technology. It's all just Css!
    
    Responsive Design Ingredients 

        1- Fluid Layouts 

            - To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or even height)

            - Use % (or vh/ vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport 
                (usually layout)
            
            - Use max-width instead of width 

        2- Responsive Units 

            - Use rem instead of px for most lengths 

            - To make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically 

            - Helphful trick: setting 1 rem to 10 px for easy calculations 

        3- Flexible images 

            - By default, images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport,
                so we need to fix that 
            
            - Always  use % image dimensions, together with the max-width property 

        4- Media Queries 

            - Bring responsive sites to life! 

            - To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths
                (called breakpoints)
        
        Desktop-First vs Mobile-first development 

            Desktop-first 

                Start writing Css for the desktop: large screen 

                Then, media queries shrink design to smaller screens 

            Mobile-First 

                Start writting Css for mobile devices: small screen 

                Then, queries expand design to a large screen 

                Forces us to reduce websites and apps tp the absolute essentials.
